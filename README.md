## Overview

This project involves a comprehensive statistical analysis of airline passenger satisfaction. The main objective was to identify factors that influence overall satisfaction, such as travel class, service ratings (Wi-Fi, cleanliness, food & drink), delays, and loyalty status. The project includes:
- Hypothesis testing
- Confidence interval estimation
- Proportional and mean comparisons

## Objective

The goal of the project was to explore key factors affecting passenger satisfaction, including:
- The relationship between travel class (Business vs. Economy) and satisfaction levels
- The impact of service attributes (Wi-Fi, food & drink, cleanliness, etc.)
- How delays and loyalty influence overall satisfaction
- Passenger demographics and their influence on satisfaction ratings

## Methods

We utilized a combination of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and analysis of proportions and means to evaluate the data. Our approach included:
- Testing the significance of factors affecting satisfaction (e.g., travel class, delays)
- Estimating confidence intervals for differences in satisfaction ratings across subgroups
- Assessing the validity of claims regarding satisfaction levels and their determinants

All statistical calculations were conducted manually by Mariam Hassan and I to ensure full understanding and application of statistical inference principles.


## Tools

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Latex for documentation

## Results

The analysis revealed several key insights, including:
- Business class passengers generally report higher satisfaction levels than economy passengers.
- Service factors like food & drink quality and cleanliness are strongly associated with overall satisfaction.
- Delays (within reasonable limits) have less impact on satisfaction than expected, suggesting other factors are more influential.
- Online booking systems need significant improvements to enhance user satisfaction, particularly for loyal passengers.
